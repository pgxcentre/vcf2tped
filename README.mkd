# vcf2tped - VCF to PLINK converter #

*Version 0.3*

_vcf2tped_ is a VCF converter that creates a transposed _pedfile_ compatible
with the PLINK analysis toolkit. It separates variations in four different
categories:

1. bi-allelic single nucleotide variations;
2. multi-allelic single nucleotide variations;
3. bi-allelic insertions/deletions;
4. and multi-allelic insertions/deletions.

By splitting the variations in those categories, it enables their analysis with
the PLINK toolkit (since PLINK cannot work with multi-allelic variations).


## Dependencies ##

The tool only requires a standard installation of [Python](http://python.org/)
version 2.7 or higher, or version 3.4 or higher.

The tool has been tested on Linux, but should work on Windows and MacOS
operating softwares as well.


## Installation ##

For Linux users, make sure that the script is executable (using the _chmod_
command). All users, you can execute the script using the following command:

```sqlite
$ vcf2tped.py --help
usage: vcf2tped.py [-h] --vcf FILE --ped FILE [-o STR]

Convert a VCF to a TPED (version 0.3).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit

Input Files:
  --vcf FILE         The VCF file.
  --ped FILE         The PED file.

Output Files:
  -o STR, --out STR  The suffix of the output file. [Default: vcf_to_tped]
```
